# Spreadsheet-like Finances

[My Notes](notes.md)

This application is a spreadsheet-like finances application. It allows users to create accounts, log in, and view their finances. The setup is simple
to understand. You can see everything at a glance. When a user logs in, they will be able to see the total you have spent in the month, your remaining budget, the 
categories that is accounting for most of your spending, as well as your monthly trend. From this page you will also be able to see a graph of your expenses over time as 
well as a breakdown of your spending by category.

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

My web app brings the simplicity of a spreadsheet to personal finance. Users can log expenses, see totals, 
and track spending trends in real time, all in a familiar, table-based interface. With intuitive charts and category breakdowns, 
it’s easy to understand where your money goes each month and make smarter financial decisions. This web app is 
perfect for anyone looking to track their finances and stay on top of their spending without having a 
complex spreadsheet or complicated interface to work with.
